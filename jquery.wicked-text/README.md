# Kajabity Wicked Text Plugin for jQuery #

The Wicked Text plugin for jQuery enables plain text to be converted to HTML using very simple Wiki style markup.

The plugin provides the following features: -

*    **$.wickedText( plaintext )** - a jQuery utility function to convert unformatted 'plaintext' to HTML.
*    **$.fn.wickedText( plaintext )** - a jQuery wrapper function to add unformatted text to a DOM object.

In addition, one or two constants and functions have been made accessible from the plugin.  

You can try out the plugin on the Test page and see the results in real time (it's quite fast, too).

Wicked Text uses a very simple textual mark-up syntax used for generating web pages. It is designed to be easy for non-technical 
users to write and edit and still produce rich, structured HTML content.  The Wicked Text format is converted to simple, clean HTML - 
it is then up to the page's CSS styling to determine how the HTML is presented.
