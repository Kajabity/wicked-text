# Wicked Text #

Wicked Text (which I originally called Wiki Text) is a fairly intuitive approach to writing plain text with some structure - paragraphs, emphasis, tables, bullets and numbering.  

Using that simple structure, the text can then be rendered into a variety of structured formats such as HTML, Rich Text, etc.
